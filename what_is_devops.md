# What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices and cultural philosophies that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, efficiency, and productivity in delivering software applications and services. It aims to bridge the gap between development teams and operations teams by fostering communication, integration, and automation.

In traditional software development approaches, development and operations were often treated as separate entities, leading to communication barriers. DevOps emerged as a response to these challenges, advocating for a collaborative and iterative approach to software delivery.

Key principles of DevOps include:

1. Collaboration: DevOps encourages close collaboration and communication between developers, operations staff, and other stakeholders involved in the software development lifecycle.

2. Continuous Integration and Deployment: DevOps promotes the automation of build, test, and deployment processes, enabling frequent and reliable software releases.

3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): DevOps emphasizes managing infrastructure and configuration through code, using tools like version-controlled scripts and templates. This approach enables consistent and reproducible deployments.

4. Continuous Monitoring: DevOps emphasizes the importance of monitoring applications and infrastructure in real-time to detect issues, gather insights, and drive continuous improvement.

5. Agile and Lean Practices: DevOps borrows concepts from Agile and Lean methodologies, such as iterative development, frequent feedback loops, and continuous improvement.

By adopting DevOps practices, organizations can achieve several benefits, including faster time to market, improved software quality, increased efficiency, reduced risks, and enhanced collaboration between teams. DevOps also promotes a culture of shared responsibility and continuous learning, enabling teams to adapt and innovate in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.

## Why choose DevOps cycle over waterfall?

The waterfall practic eonly allowed development in one direction which meant you couldnt go back and change or add in any features. This meant that you would only have a working product at the end of the process which could be years in the making, and this could be outdated and unwanted. DevOps allows for iterative agile methodology, which means you work in sprints. Sprints usually last about 2 weeks and in this time the aim is to create a feature, or a working piece of code to add on to the already existing working product. When released after two weeks the product should still be running and improved. It allows you to change features, improving them or updating them. Its a continous cycle of improving the working product in manageble chunks, rather then aiming to complete the entire thing and then releasing it. The value for the buisness is from the working product. Just having code is no value to the company.

DevOps can set up a dev environment which correlates with the automation process. This means all developers can work on the same environment and so the software will work on everyones machine and equipment. The environment consists not only of the virtual machine but also the dependancies, settings, versions, operating system.
